        <h1 class="site-notification">**This form will NOT email me automatically until it is hooked into a web application. It will open your default mail app on your device to email me the information you put in to send the email manually, so make sure you choose your email app when asked how to open the link. This will be updated and changed in the near future.**</h1>

        <h1 class="site-notification">As the site is still being built and upgraded, there is currently no way to choose from a dropdown menu for instance, but this functionality is coming where services will be separated in their own categories. You can use this form to provide all the details you have about a project. Do you need something specific? Are you looking for guidance? Do you need monthly maintenance, upgrades, or more than a one-time project? Provide as much of this as you can. *If you have a business idea, do not provide specific details about the idea without an NDA signed. For instance, if your idea was a social media type site, don't provide details about exactly how it works, but provide key details such as "the database needs users, and the users need posts" etc. Once an NDA is signed, this can be discussed in a meeting instead. The Contact page will allow you to submit information.*</h1>.</h1>
