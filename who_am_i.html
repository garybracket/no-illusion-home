            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This text is only here until I have time to write a biography, but in the mean-time, I can just kind of paste some text from my LinkedIn profile here.
                Estimated Skill Level 1-5 (1; little experience, 5; mastered or close) I used AI to generate the table, 'cuz why not?' </p>

                Question: Why is this site so simple?
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: I believe less is more, especially when the goal is to provide information, rather than any kind of complex functionality. Therefore, I built this mostly with AI Prompts! It does help to know your terminology and how to use AI prompts effectively. It also helps to already know how to code!

                Question: So what can you do for me or my business?
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: The answer to this is generally "well, what do you want me to do?" I have used many programming languages, a lot of software (both paid and free), consulted on a ton of projects, including providing advice on current software/hardware and better/cheaper/free alternatives!

                Question: What's the deal with No Illusion?
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: I conceptualized this business to learn new things, apply old things, and generally move forward in my career and life. The idea for No Illusion is that after working for small businesses, corporations, etc. I realized that a lot of "software development", engineers, etc. has become a predatory field that preys on uneducated managers, individuals, and small businesses! You can get a $50,000 quote for a small project, and you can get a $10,000 or even $5,000 dollar quote for the same or a similar project. There is really no consistency in this business, and a lot of companies have the tendency to include un-necesssary staff such as Project Managers, Testers, QA, etc. where-as one person (the primary developer) can actually complete all of this on their own. The entire concept behind No Illusion is that there are no games, no gimmicks, no tricks, and no manipulation. I do all of my work on my own, and typically only use AI to find mistakes or help test, as AI is incapable of the entire cycle of problem -> requirements -> solution. This entire site is hand-written in detail with the exception of the descriptions of services on the Services page (which are currently placeholders).

                Question: Why only websites, web apps, and not Android or iPhone apps?
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: I simply do not have staff or time to learn the entire structure of developing Apps. I can write a basic Notes app in a day or so, but complex functionality and logic would require a lot more education and I do work a full-time job on the side of this business. I also happen to think that Web Apps and Progressive Web Apps are the future! A web app (which I can post some examples of once this site is re-written) that works well in a browser and can function like an App Store app is more accessible, and doesn't require constant reewrites as every device has at least one browser! Did you know Apple and Google charge 30% commission on any and all app sales including in-app purchases? Predatory!

                Question: Will all websites and apps be as ugly as this or one of your other demo apps?
                <br />
                <br />
                Answer: Maybe. Functionality over Form is how I think.
